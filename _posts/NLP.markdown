## Reading Reflection 4 - *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* ##

Natural Langue Processing (NLP) is at the intersection of linguistics, computer science and humanities. After two months into the course, I have only further realized that in the modern age of digitalization, the interaction between computers and human languages are knitted tightly together. NLP really opened my mind to the extent of powerfulness that modern computer programs can be. For example, NLP models can understand and analyze contextual nuances that even some humans can't notice or comprehend, which to me is shocking since humans no longer are the experts of understanding and comprehending human languages. Various applications could be developed using NLP technology, such as document catagorization and organization, information extraction or filtering, speech recognition and beyond. As part of the reflection, I googled a lot of information about the history of the development of NLP.

From the The Georgetown experiment in 1954 that successfully translated over 60 russian sentences into English using fully automatic programs, NLPs have been progressing rapidly over the past few decades. Up until the 1980s, NLP technology has focused more on symbolic understanding and interpretation, which were fundamental to the further advancement of the technology and computer models. Sinece 1990, statistical NLP has taken the lead in the field of natural language processing. IBM Research hugely aided the progress through the implementation of machine learning-based translation systems. Moreover, statistical NLP has gradually evolved into neural NLP these days as other neural-based computer programs and theories have been applied to the field of NLP. For example, a very hot topic in NLP these days is called deep neural network, which Tufts teaches an entire course around the concept. NLP's business potential is also huge, for example, it has been widely used in the healthcare industry as the standard procedure for analyzing electronic health records content. Without a doubt, the tasks that NLPs can perform will no longer be limited to speech recognition or text to speech translation, it will further be developted to understand relational semantics and logical semantics too.
