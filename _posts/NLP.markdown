## Reading Reflection 4 - *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* ##

Natural Langue Processing (NLP) is at the intersection of linguistics, computer science and humanities. After two months into the course, I have only further realized that in the modern age of digitalization, the interaction between computers and human languages are knitted tightly together. NLP really opened my mind to the extent of powerfulness that modern computer programs can be. For example, NLP models can understand and analyze contextual nuances that even some humans can't notice or comprehend, which to me is shocking since humans no longer are the experts of understanding and comprehending human languages. Various applications could be developed using NLP technology, such as document catagorization and organization, information extraction or filtering, speech recognition and beyond. As part of the reflection, I googled a lot of information about the history of the development of NLP.
