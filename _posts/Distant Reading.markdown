## Reading Reflection 2 - *Distant Reading* ##

Distant reading has recently emerged as a computer-assisted scholarly approach to reading literary texts. Developed by Franco Moretti, the concept of distant reading utilizes and heavily relies on big data analytics for literature comprehension. The Wikipedia page only provides trivial information about Franco and his "Conjectures on World Literature" work that first brought up the concept of "not reading books" is the best way to deal with the overwhelmingness of existing and past literature pieces. I did a little bit more research into his work and background to try to understand the rationale and logic behind his methodology of distant reading. Prior to theorizing the concept of Distant Reading, I learned that he founded the Stanford Literary Lab, which adopts untraditional methods to tackle literary problems by scientific means: hypothesis-testing, computational modeling, quantitative analysis and so on and so forth. However, even with the assist of technology and efficient analytical models, Franco wanted a more radical appraoch, which eventually became what he called "DIstant Reading". The concept states that to understand literature, one should not study particular texts or any specific pieces of work, rather, one should aggregate and analyze the so called "big data" of the literature work. To use an analogy, even if one person can successfully and effectively read through the entire collections of Victorian fictions, there are still over 60,000 other novels published in 19th-century England
