## Why Visual Literacy Is Essential To Good Data Visualization ##

After reading "Why visual literacy is essential to good data visualization", I wanted to dedicate this page to a brief reflection on the topic as the content of the reading resonates with my own learning and past exercises done on Programming Historians. 

The author suggests that being able to understand and interpret visual information is crucial for creating effective data visualizations. As a way of presenting information in a graphical or visual format, Data visualization can be an effective way to communicate complex ideas or patterns in data. However, if the visualizations are not designed or interpreted correctly, they can be misleading or confusing, which is why visual literacy is such an essential component of good data visualization because it involves the ability to interpret and understand data represented. Some of the mentioned sub-categories of visual literacy includes the ability to recognize patterns, trends, and relationships among data points, as well as the ability to read and interpret charts, graphs, and other visual elements. The reading once again made me realize how powerful the current data visualization technologies are, but atthe same time reminds me of the limitations of the current processing technologies behind the algorithms. Good data visualization involves more than just creating aesthetically pleasing visuals. It requires designing visuals that clearly and accurately represent the data and that are easy to comprehend. 

For the reasons above, I agree with the assertion that visual literacy is essential for good data visualization. Effective data visualization requires not only a deep understanding of the data being presented, but also an understanding of how to effectively communicate that information through visual means. This requires knowledge of design principles and the ability to interpret visual representations of data.
