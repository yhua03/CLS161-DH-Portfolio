## Chapter 2 - *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* ##

Prior to reading the passages and articles, I had little knowledge of the history of Roman Empire besides its glory at once upon a time. The Wikipedia page provides a very concise overview of the outline of Gibbon's _The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_. I also agree with the analysis of Gibbon's tone throughout the passage, which were characterized by his dispassionate yet critical styles. One of his quote "History is, indeed, little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.", was a representative attitude of his throughout his work that explained how the Roman Empire fell from its golden ages. It is also interesting to read Gibbon's perspectives on the impact of religion and the so called barbarism over Roman Empire's decline, his original quote as ‘the triumph of barbarism and religion’. The concept of enlightment was especially influenced by Christianity as it aimed to modify both the belief and doctrine of it. 

After reading _An Overview of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, I was further intrigued by whether Gibbon's work still impacts the historians and researchers of the Roman Empire and Byzantine period. Thus, I further decided to read chapter 4 of the The Cambridge Companion to Edward Gibbon, denoted as _4 - Do Byzantine Historians Still Read Gibbon?_. The author straightforwardly addresses thee question that he/she raised with a simple answer of "no". It was a little shocking for me to see the conclusion, because from the previous readings it seemed Gibbon's impact as a historian and writer was phenomenal to the research area. However, the fact that he is very fewly cited and referred to in modern work of the Byzantinists shows that not many researchers directly read his passages anymore. Howeveer, his influence has already extended beyond his own work. His ideas have been infused into other people's words and thoughts, which continuously to contribute to the modern research of Roman Empire and Byzantine period.
