## Learning Reflection 5 - *Python - My learning Journey* ##

As the semester comes to an end, I want to dedicate this post to my reflection on what I’ve learned about Python as both a programming language and a tool for advanced computer applications. First of all, I’ve to admit that I prefer Python way over other programming languages that I’ve learned, including C++ and JavaScript. For one reason, I’ve always enjoyed a concise style of writing, and that is consistent even when I write complex programming codes. Python has a far simpler syntax system compared to other languages, which in turn results in less coding time and less space occupied. Moreover, besides what I’ve learned in class, I did some extra research on certain topics, especially on API, which is where I found out the abundance of Python support communities that helped me address questions ranging from how to execute a line of code to how to write a working interface. There also exists hundreds if not thousands of Python libraries that contain a range of robust functions and capabilities that enable programmers, even newbies like me, to start writing with versatility and elegance. I’ve also found that Python is a primary-used language in the general software development market. Realistically speaking, having the skill as a college graduate will position myself ahead of my peers who are not as Python-literate when looking for jobs or roles that require certain programming skills. And for all these reasons above, I really enjoyed learning Python and taking CLS 161!
