## Evaluation

One of the most interesting projects among the listed DH Projects on Canvas is the Plant Humanities Lab. I will dedicate this page to an evaluation of the project from both the lens of humanities and computer science. 

Quoting JSTOR Labs, the organization that enabled the creation of Plant Humanities Lab, "The Plant Humanities Lab uses original scholarship, linked open data and integrated primary and secondary resources to narrate and to foster the exploration of the cultural histories of plants and their influence on human societies."  The beta version of Plant Humanities Lab was recently released in March 2021, which is less than two years ago from today. I will delve into the more technical aspects of the project such as data structure and linked libraries first. Once you open the window of the page, there is a search bar on the middle top of the page.
