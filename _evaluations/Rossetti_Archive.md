## Evaluation

"Bookworm" from HathiTrust is a digital tool which allows users to search the HathiTrust digital library for word counts for any given term or set of terms. This allows users to look up a word and see how often that word occurs each year. According to the project web page, this took was originally created by Ben Sschmidt at Harvard University for Google's Ngram viewer but was adapted for the HathiTrust digital library by Peter Organisciak(Who is now at the University of Denver.)

The basic search feature allows for a number of different filters such as "Fiction or Not Fiction", Genres, Languages, Author, and others. This may allow for more nuanced searching. Users can search for multiple terms but not for bigrams or phrases. For example, you can search for "science" and "fiction" but not "science fiction." This seems somewhat limiting to me.

As a working example, I searched for "atheism," "atheist," "agnosticism," and "agnotic." "Atheism" and "atheist" reach something of a peak a little after 1800 CE whereas "agnosticism" and "agnostic" reach a much smaller peak a little before 1900 CE. It also appears that there is a slight up tick in each term right around 2000 CE. Perhaps most telling is that there is a steep increase in the use of the term "atheism" from about 1770 CE to about 1803 CE. Here is an example of that search:
