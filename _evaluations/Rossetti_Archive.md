## Evaluation

The Rossetti Archive is a digital collection that aims to capture every single surviving piece of work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti(DGR). As a painter, designer, writer, and translator, DGR impacted various fields of art during the second half of the nineteenth century in Great Britain. The Archive serves a really valuable tool for researchers or the general public to learn about DGR and his legacy through visualized documentation of his work. 

The Archive was completed in 2008 but continues to add any newly identified or created pieces of work of DGR. The Archive also does a great job in terms of device adapatbility. The Rossetti Archive is optimized for web browsers that comply with current HTML and CSS, which basicallyy means you can access the weebsite through any browser even on mobile devices. 

Some notable features of the Archive include a serach engine that allows users to set customized search filters to effectively and precisely locate the information desired. For example, users can search by the title of the work, the genre of the work or the date of completion of the work. There's even a boolean search function where users can put two parameters and search for entires that fulfill the boolean filter. The screenshot below shows what the search engine looks like:

The screenshot on the left showcases Rossetti's work as an poet and the screenshot to the right showcases his work as an artist. As a digital collection of Rossetti's work throughout his life, the Archive is a valuable tool for anyone, whether out or curiosity or research goals, to examine the work and life of a great artist and poet in the history.
